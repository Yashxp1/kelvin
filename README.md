# Kelvin, AI Workflow Automation Platform

Kelvin is an AI-powered workflow automation tool that helps developers interact with GitHub and Notion using natural language. It connects real developer tools with LLM-driven actions to reduce repetitive work and speed up everyday tasks.

## What Kelvin Does

Kelvin allows users to log in, connect their tools, and perform actions using AI-driven workflows.

### Authentication
- Google OAuth
- Email-based authentication

### GitHub Integration
Users can:
- Create GitHub issues using AI
- Summarise pull requests
- Edit existing files and create a pull request
- Create an entirely new pull request using AI-generated changes

### Notion Integration
Users can:
- Summarise existing Notion pages using AI
- Create new Notion page entries generated by AI

### Extras
- View past prompts and generated summaries
- Persistent history per user

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes  
- **Auth:** OAuth (Google), Email Auth  
- **AI:** Gemini API  
- **Integrations:** GitHub API, Notion API  
- **Database:** (Add your DB here — e.g. PostgreSQL / Prisma / Supabase)

## Why This Project Exists

The goal of this project was to:
- Build a real AI-powered product, not a chatbot clone
- Work with real third-party APIs (GitHub, Notion)
- Handle authentication, permissions, and side effects safely
- Design an agent-style workflow instead of prompt dumping

This project focuses on **integration, orchestration, and deployment**, not just AI responses.

---

## Current Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**

- Core workflows are implemented
- UI and UX are actively being refined
- Some advanced actions are intentionally limited in demo mode
- Error handling, guardrails, and rate limits are being improved

---

## Planned Improvements

- Better action previews and confirmations
- Stronger permission controls per integration
- Improved UX for multi-step workflows
- More granular prompt history and filtering
- Usage limits and quota visibility

---

## Demo

A live demo will be added once the project reaches a stable milestone.

(Temporary limits will be applied to AI actions to prevent abuse.)

---

## Notes

This project uses the Gemini API for AI generation.  
Some limitations exist due to API quotas and rate limits. These can be easily improved by switching to a paid or higher-tier plan.

---

## Disclaimer

Kelvin is a personal portfolio project and is **not intended for production use** at this stage.  
Actions that modify external services (GitHub, Notion) are restricted and require explicit user authorization.
