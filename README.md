# Kelvin — AI Workflow Automation Platform

Kelvin is a production-grade AI workflow automation platform that enables developers to interact with real tools like GitHub and Notion using natural language.  
It translates high-level intent into **safe, structured, tool-aware actions**, reducing repetitive engineering work.

## 🚀 What Kelvin Does

Kelvin allows authenticated users to connect external tools and perform complex actions through AI-driven workflows.

Unlike simple chatbots, Kelvin:
- Operates on **real APIs**
- Executes **multi-step actions**
- Persists history and state
- Enforces authentication and permissions

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Google OAuth
- Email-based authentication
- Per-user session isolation
- Secure token handling

---

## 🧠 GitHub Integration

Kelvin can perform real GitHub operations, including:

- Create GitHub issues from natural language
- Summarise pull requests
- Edit existing files and open pull requests
- Generate and create new pull requests using AI-driven changes

All actions are scoped to the user’s authorized repositories.

---

## 📄 Notion Integration

Kelvin supports Notion workflows such as:

- Summarising existing Notion pages
- Creating new Notion pages generated by AI
- Persisting generated content per user

---

## ➕ Additional Capabilities

- Persistent prompt and action history per user
- Structured AI responses (not raw text dumping)
- Clear separation between intent parsing and execution
- Guardrails around destructive actions

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tanstack Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Backend:** Next.js API routes (server-heavy architecture)  
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth, Email Auth  
- **AI:** Gemini API  
- **Integrations:** GitHub API, Notion API  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Prisma  

---

## 🧠 Architecture Highlights

- Modular, domain-based backend structure
- Clear separation of controllers, services, and integrations
- Agent-style workflow orchestration instead of single-shot prompts
- Persistent data layer for users, history, and integrations
- Production deployment with environment isolation

This project prioritises **correctness, safety, and maintainability** over shortcuts.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Exists

Kelvin was built to explore and demonstrate:

- Building AI systems that interact with **real-world tools**
- Managing authentication and third-party permissions correctly
- Designing workflows that go beyond “chat with AI”
- Handling side effects safely in an AI-driven system
- Shipping and deploying a backend-heavy product

This is not a chatbot clone.  
It is an **integration and orchestration platform**.

---

## 🌐 Live Demo

Kelvin is live and deployed.

> Some actions are intentionally rate-limited or restricted to prevent abuse and protect connected accounts.

---

## ⚠️ Notes & Limitations

- AI usage is subject to Gemini API quotas
- Some advanced or destructive actions are gated
- Limits can be expanded easily with higher-tier API access

---

## 📌 Disclaimer

Kelvin is a personal portfolio project.

While it is fully functional and deployed, it is **not positioned as a commercial SaaS product**.  
All actions affecting external services (GitHub, Notion) require explicit user authorization and confirmation.
